name: exp-loop
description: Run a semi-autonomous experiment loop — analyze the latest run, design the next experiment, evaluate a candidate, keep or discard it, log the decision, and repeat until a deadline or a stop condition. The "leaving-work" deadline governs only the analyze/design/eval phases; the next TRAINING LAUNCH is queued as a pending-approval artifact and NEVER auto-fired. Use when the user says "run the analyze→design→eval loop", "퇴근할 거니까 알아서 분석하고 다음 실험까지 큐에 넣어둬", "iterate on this experiment automatically", "keep evaluating candidates and keep the best". Triggers on "experiment loop", "auto-iterate", "다음 실험까지 돌려놔", "loop until".

# exp-loop — semi-autonomous analyze→design→eval→keep/discard→log loop

## Overview

`exp-loop` chains the OMX skills into one supervised loop over a single run:

```
analyze (exp-analyze) -> design (exp-design) -> evaluate candidate (omx eval)
   -> keep/discard (omx decision via the core) -> log the iteration (ledger)
   -> queue the next launch (pending approval) -> STOP for human, or repeat
```

It NEVER launches training (design D4/B8). The "leaving-work" deadline is a
ceiling on the AUTONOMOUS phases (analyze/design/eval). The next training run is
always written to `runs/<run_id>/pending-launch.json` as `pending approval` for
the human to fire by hand. This honors the repo rule "훈련 종료/시작은 유저가
직접" with no override path.

**Announce at start:** "Using exp-loop to run the analyze→design→eval loop; training launch will be queued for your approval, never fired."

## Preconditions (check, don't assume)

1. A profile exists at `.omx/profile/` (run `exp-init` first if not). You need
   `metrics.yaml` (for `output_root` + the metric vocabulary) and `evaluator.sh`
   (the eval command) — both written by exp-init.
2. A `run_id` is given (the experiment to iterate on). If absent, ask for it and STOP.
3. The run has at least one analyzable result (an eval summary / training log the
   profile's adapters can ingest). If there is nothing to analyze, say so and STOP.

If any precondition is unmet, state exactly what is missing and STOP. Never
fabricate a run or invent an evaluator.

## Session id (scratch isolation, B2)

Resolve a session id once: `omx session-id` (it applies `--session-id` flag →
`OMX_SESSION_ID` env → autogen). Pass it to exp-analyze when you delegate.

## The deadline ceiling (the "leaving-work" toggle)

If the user gives `--max-runtime <seconds>` (or says "퇴근할 거니까"), the loop
runs autonomously until that ceiling. You do NOT compute the deadline yourself —
the core does it. BEFORE each iteration, ask the CLI for the loop status, passing
the run's `--max-runtime` (the CLI computes `deadline = now + max-runtime` and
reports whether it has passed):

```bash
omx loop-status --root <root> --run-id <run_id> --max-runtime <seconds>
```

If its JSON shows `"deadline_passed": true`, STOP the autonomous loop (do NOT
start another analyze/design/eval pass). The deadline NEVER triggers a launch —
it only stops analysis. With no `--max-runtime`, run exactly ONE iteration then
stop and report (a single supervised pass is the safe default).

## One iteration

### 1. Analyze
Delegate to `exp-analyze` for `<run_id>` (it writes `report.md` + promoted plots
to the permanent tree and emits evidence-tagged findings). Capture the
`analysis_id` it reports.

### 2. Design
Delegate to `exp-design` with that `report.md` (`<run_id>` + `<analysis_id>`). It
runs the 3-lane diagnosis and writes a `proposals/<proposal_id>.md` (the
discriminating probe = the next experiment), `pending approval`. Capture the
`proposal_id`.

### 3. Evaluate the current candidate (if one exists)
A "candidate" here is an already-trained checkpoint the human produced for this
run (exp-loop does NOT train). If the profile's `evaluator.sh` can grade the
current checkpoint, run it through the core (this is the single source of the
pass/score verdict — never eyeball a metric):

```bash
omx eval --command 'bash .omx/profile/evaluator.sh' --cwd <project_dir> \
    --keep-policy <pass_only|score_improvement> --last-kept-score <prev_or_omit>
```

The JSON includes a `decision` block (`keep`/`discard`/`ambiguous`/`bootstrap`)
when `--keep-policy` is set. That decision is authoritative. If there is no new
candidate to grade (e.g. this is the very first analysis pass), skip evaluation
and go straight to queuing the next launch.

### 4. Record the iteration (keep/discard target = B6)
The core has already applied the keep/discard pointer rule inside the ledger.
Record this iteration through the ledger writer (config reverts via git; weights
revert via the `last_kept_checkpoint` pointer — keep advances, non-keep leaves;
NO git/rm on weight files). You do NOT git-revert or delete any checkpoint
yourself in v0.1 — the ledger pointer + decision-log is the record; physical
checkpoint GC is out of scope (design §9). If a config edit was made and the
decision is `discard`, tell the user the exact `git revert`/`git checkout`
command to unwind to `baseline_commit` (from `ledger.json`) — but do NOT run it
unless they explicitly approve (minimum-change revert, repo rule).

### 5. Queue the next launch (NEVER fire it — B8)
The proposal from step 2 is the next experiment. Queue it for human approval:

```bash
omx queue-launch --root <root> --run-id <run_id> \
    --proposal-id <proposal_id> \
    --launch-delta "<the one-line change vs profile launch.sh, from the proposal>" \
    --gpu-gate "<the nvidia-smi precondition, e.g. 'GPU0 free per nvidia-smi'>"
```

This writes `runs/<run_id>/pending-launch.json` marked `pending approval`. STOP
here for the launch. You have NOT trained anything. Tell the user the proposal +
the queued launch, and that THEY must approve and run the training command.

### 6. Audit the wiki at iteration end (report-only, never auto-fix)

At the end of each iteration, audit the accumulated wiki so stale/orphaned/broken
knowledge surfaces (it is review-gated - you report, the human decides):

`omx wiki lint --root <root>`

Report any `stale` / `broken-ref` / `broken-frontmatter` issues to the user in your
summary. Do NOT auto-edit or delete any page (minimum-change / review-gated rule).

### 7. Loop or stop
If a deadline is set and `omx loop-status` says it has NOT passed AND there is a
fresh candidate to analyze next, repeat from step 1. Otherwise STOP.

## Hard constraints (never violate)

- NEVER launch or start a training run. exp-loop only QUEUES launches via
  `omx queue-launch`. No `bash launch.sh`, no training subprocess, ever (D4/B8).
- NEVER auto-run a `git revert`/`git reset`/`rm` on weights or config. Surface
  the exact command; the human runs it (minimum-change revert rule).
- NEVER hand-write a `.omx/` path. Queue/status/eval all go through the `omx`
  CLI verbs, which resolve paths via the core (path-SSOT).
- NEVER invent a verdict. The pass/score decision comes ONLY from `omx eval`'s
  JSON (the evaluator contract), and the keep/discard from its `decision` block.
- The deadline ceiling gates ONLY analyze/design/eval — it is NEVER a launch
  trigger.
- NEVER auto-fix, edit, or delete a wiki page from a lint result. lint is
  report-only; the human decides any change (review-gated).
- Respond to the user in Korean (repo rule); keep skill/code/markdown in English.

## When done

Report, in Korean to the user:
- where the analysis report and proposal are (permanent tree paths),
- the keep/discard decision(s) and the reason (from the decision-log),
- that the next launch is QUEUED at `runs/<run_id>/pending-launch.json` as
  **pending approval — not launched**, and the exact training command they should
  run after approving.

This is the last skill in the OMX set. There is no successor loop to start.
